Naive Bayes Classifier

The reviews in the initial data set are coming from very different topics.
The language used to describe dvds and musics is going to ve bery different than the language used in books and health.
I think this very broad scope of languague messes with the probabilities used to classify the reviews.

- 11784: talks about the negatives of product but says its perfect. That one perfect words doesnt overpower the other "negative" words
- 11801: short. english mistakes. talks about personal story not really using "rating" words
- 9764: short. confusing language. The person says they like one half of the product and dislikes the other half.
