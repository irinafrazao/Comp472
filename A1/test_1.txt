software pos 211.txt I've only been in a recording studio 3 times and I have a vague understanding of what he was doing, unfortunately I was usually in the vocal booth while he did most of the work so I only heard the adjustments being made. I use this software with the Blue Yeti Pro microphone and so far have been told the recordings sound like studio quality. I did a lot of research on microphone setup and learning music editing terms for vocals. This software has a lot of features and does exactly what I need it to do, the user manual and help within the software is great, and the customer support has been excellent as well. I wrote an email to support on a Friday evening about a certain problem I was having and Tuesday morning of the following I had the problem resolved.
software neg 101.txt Don't waste you money. Piece of crap! Gopro Studio works better than this. 
music neg 492.txt  I should have known better, but was hoping that this album dipped into Celine's Francophile musical heritage. (Linda Ronstadt's spanish-language album comes to mind.) Instead, it is new songs, heavily enhanced electronically. Dion is an awesome singer, but this selection and treatment is not what I was looking for.
