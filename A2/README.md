The project contains several python scripts and text files for the puzzle inputs and the corresponding results after computation.

Please run mainClass.py in spyder or any other IDE of your choice. 
The code should use the random puzzles provided in the inputs.txt file and output all the results for all 3 algorithms in results.txt.
