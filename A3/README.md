The project contains only 3 python scripts: mainClass.py, utilClass.py and Node.py. 
It also has a text file "testcases.txt" for the different inputs.

Please run mainClass.py in spyder or any other IDE of your choice. 
The code should read the 10 test cases provided in testcases.txt and output in the console the result for each test case.
